# Group_A_TaxFilingSoftware
Software Development in C Project - Testing changes made via PR

# Problem Statement:
International students face a lot of problems in Canada when filing the taxes as they need to indulge with the rules and regulations of a new country. Apart from this, when you complete your tax return by hand, you must tally up all the numbers yourself in a spreadsheet or using a calculator. As it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to claim any tax credit or deduction that he/she is entitled to, any missed amount can have costly consequences. When you file your own tax return, you are responsible for ensuring that all of your information is organized and completed accurately throughout each form. Not only can you easily enter in incorrect numbers or make typos, but you may mistakenly calculate credits, deductions and other relevant amounts.
Hence, the main motive of the project is to develop an easy-to-go tax filing software which helps students to file taxes through a simple interview process without involving themselves into complicated maths. Also, when you file using tax preparation software, you will be asked a series of questions to determine if you qualify for certain tax deductions and credits. With tax preparation software, however, not only are all of the necessary calculations completed for you, but any special forms are automatically filled out with your verified personal information as well.
Summing up, this tax filing software for international students will save up their precious time and easily file the tax returns.
